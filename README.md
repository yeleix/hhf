### User Stories
1) As a user, I want to be able to sign-up
2) As a user, I want to be able to sign in
3) As a user, I want to be able to change my password
4) As a user, I want to be able to sign out

*AJAX* (CRUD - create, read, update, destroy)
1) As a user, I want to be able to — create items
2) As a user, I want to be able to — see items(s)
3) As a user, I want to be able to — update an item
4) As a user, I want to be able to — remove an item



### PROCESS
I decided to design the backend first, and build out back end based on the ERD. The app needed to allow a user CRUD on items.

Once the backend was set up, I mapped out the front end layer. This is the first time I am using Ember.js, so I was in a dilemma before deciding to go with the framework. There are many layers (or components in EmberJs's case) so I wanted to keep this web application simple.

Generating a frontend browser using ember was an exciting process yet terrifying. One thing I enjoyed about ember was how convenient the components became in the long-run. However, understanding how each layer of Ember works was a complicated and stressful process.


### FUTURE
- Being able to cross out the item & due date after checking box
- UI fixes (mainly how the task is being rendered)
- - draggable task
- labels
